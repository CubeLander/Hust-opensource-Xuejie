The ongoing bushfires that have devastated Australia closed in on the country's capital, Canberra, last Friday as it declared its first state of emergency since 2003.
The Rural Fire Service of New South Wales, the state surrounding the capital, warned of severe fire danger for the Australian Capital Territory, with flames and embers projected to spread well inside the region on Saturday. The territory is home to more than 400,000 residents, and nearly half of it is at risk of "ember attack" and flames.

The novel coronavirus death toll has reached 21 as of Saturday in Britain as the number of confirmed cases totalled 1,140, according to the latest figures released by the British Department of Health and Social Care.

The new figures showed an increase of 342 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Britain, the largest rise on a single day since the start of the outbreak in the country. Ten more patients who contracted coronavirus died, bringing the death toll in Britain to 21.

All the 10 patients who died were aged over 60 and had underlying health conditions, said Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England.

According to health authorities, most of the cases are in England. There have been 121 confirmed cases in Scotland, 60 in Wales and 34 in Northern Ireland.

The British government said on Friday that it estimated the true number of infected cases in Britain to be around 5,000 to 10,000. People who are self-isolating with mild symptoms are no longer being tested for the virus.
