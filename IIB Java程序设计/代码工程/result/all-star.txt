Perhaps no one in recent history cared more about winning the All-Star Game than Kobe Bryant.

The format changes and his memory combined to create a game Sunday night at the United Center that would've made Bryant proud.
Technically, the winners were Team LeBron over Team Giannis 157-155 and local charities, as $500,000 was donated.
The last hero was Chicago native Anthony Davis, who made the winning free throw. But the real victor was the competitive spirit Bryant embodied.
